# Challenge 2: Conditional Statements
In this challenge, you have been tasked to write a program that calculates the BMI of the person and tells them whether they are overweight or underweight. 

| BMI Range(w) 			| Status			|
|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
|bmi < 18.5				| Underweight 	|
|18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9	| Normal Weight	|
|25.0 <= bmi <= 29.9	| Overweight		|
|bmi > 30.0				| Obese			|

### Inputs
- The person's `height` in cn
- The person's `weight` in kg

### Outputs
- The person's `bmi` and message stating their `bmi_status`

### Tips
- Follow the BMI calculation logic from the previous challenge
- Use the `if elif else` statements that you have learnt

### Sample
```
What is your height (cm)? 163
What is your weight (kg)? 45
Your BMI is 16.94 and you are underweight
```
```
What is your height (cm)? 163
What is your weight (kg)? 57
Your BMI is 21.5 and you are of normal weight :)
```
```
What is your height (cm)? 163
What is your weight (kg)? 70
