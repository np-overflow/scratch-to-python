# Challenge 1: Primitive Data Types
In this challenge, you have been tasked to write a simple program that calculates
the BMI of a person.

### Inputs
- The person's `height` in cm
- The person's `mass` in kg
 
### Outputs
- The person's `bmi`

### Tips
- Remember to convert the `height` to m
- `input` receives the user input as a `str`, not a `float` or an `int`

### Sample
```
What is your height? 163
What is your weight? 57
Your BMI is 21.5!
```
