    "Conditional statements are just like light switches. You only want the light to turn on only when the switch is turned on.\n",
    "This is similar to conditional statements in code. \n",
    "    In code, you use `if`, `else`, and `elif`(else if) statements to control whether a block of code should be executed. \n",

    "    do_something\n",

    "The conditions in if statements are always **booleans** (True / False)\n",
    "\n",
